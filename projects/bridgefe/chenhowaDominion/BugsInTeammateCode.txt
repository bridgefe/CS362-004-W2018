Bug 1: 
Adventurer card. drawn treasure set to a value of 1. should be a value of 0 to begin.
This causes both test cases to fail. No two treasure drawn, and no two cards drawn

line 1238 in dominion.c 

Testing the adventurer card

test 1 ->> Treasure increase

Player 1 treasure increases by 2
Test: FAILED

test 2 ->> Draw two cards

Player 1 adds 2 cards to hand
Test: FAILED


Bug 2:
Smithy card. Improper number number of cards in hand. should be increased by 3. this passed
my smithy card test, but failed my random card test. Upon investication, it was 
due to a handpos-- on line 1264 of dominion.c this starts the hand position at an 
unexpected location. should be 0 it is discarding from the wrong position in the hand.
Tricky to catch as it passes the tests for discard check
